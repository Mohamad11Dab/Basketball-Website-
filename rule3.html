                <div class="inset"><h3>9. Defenders can legally block or steal the ball</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The primary objective of the team in defense is to stop the opposing team from scoring by employing various defensive strategies such as intercepting or obstructing the ball and preventing offensive players from making successful shots.
                        </p>

                 <div class="inset"><h3>10. Defenders must leave the paint after three seconds.</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The region immediately preceding the basketball hoop is commonly known as "the paint" or "inside the key". Offensive players are prohibited from lingering in this area while awaiting a pass or rebound. A player can occupy this zone for no longer than three seconds at a time before they must vacate it. The player may re-enter after stepping out of the paint. Should the official observe a player remaining within the paint for more than three seconds, the team will commit a three-second violation.</p>

                 <div class="inset"><h3>11. Each team is allotted a certain number of fouls</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The NBA allows each team a total of five fouls per quarter. Once a team surpasses this allotment, they go “into the bonus,” which means the officials will award the opposing team with free throws for every additional foul that a player commits in that quarter of play. In the NCAA, these foul shots are known as "one and one" shots, which means that if a player makes the first free throw, they receive a second free throw. If they miss the first free throw, either team can rebound the errant shot and claim possession. After 10 team fouls, the opposing team gets a "double bonus," which means they get to take two foul shots.</p>

                 <div class="inset"><h3>12. Illegal contact results in a foul</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p> When a basketball player commits illegal physical contact against an opposing player, the referees will call a personal foul. Most player fouls involve contact that impedes an opposing player's gameplay. When a player fouls another player on an opposing team in the act of shooting, the referee rewards the fouled player with unguarded free throws from the foul line. Each successfully made free throw counts for one point. Referees can assess coaches with fouls for unsportsmanlike acts, such as using profanity to dispute a missed call.</p>
