                    <br>
                    <p>In basketball games at the NBA, WNBA, and NCAA levels, each team is allowed to have a maximum of five players on the court during play. Failure to adhere to this fundamental rule can result in a turnover, whereby the team loses possession of the ball to their opponents. Instances of this occurring are typically unintentional, especially at lower levels of the game, when substitute players enter the game, and some players fail to exit the court in a timely manner.</p>

                 <div class="inset"><h3>2. Score more than your opponent to win</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>To win the game, a team must score more field goals than the other team. A field goal refers to any basket a player scores during gameplay. Field goals can be worth two or three points. Field goals shot from inside the arc that designates the three-point line on the court are worth two points. Field goals shot from outside the arc are worth three points. Field goals can take the form of jump shots, layups, slam dunks, and tip-ins.</p>

                 <div class="inset"><h3>3. Score within the shot clock</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Each basketball team is given a specific amount of time to make their shot during a particular possession. This allotted time differs depending on the league- NBA and WNBA teams have 24 seconds, while NCAA teams have 30 seconds before they must take their shot. A visible timer, known as a shot clock, is positioned above each hoop on both sides of the court to display and count down this designated time. If the shot clock runs out before the team takes its shot, then it results in a turnover, and the opposing team gets control of the ball for defensive play.</p>

                 <div class="inset"><h3>4. Dribbling advances the ball</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>In basketball, the only ways to move the ball up and down the court are through passing or dribbling. Once a player has stopped dribbling, they cannot start again but must either pass or shoot. If an offensive player stops their dribble and then resumes without passing or shooting, it will result in a "double dribble" call by the referee, leading to a turnover for the opposing team. Additionally, players are not allowed to run while holding onto the ball - doing so is considered as traveling, and the other team will get possession of the ball upon receiving the "traveling" signal from the referees.</p>
