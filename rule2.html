                <div class="inset"><h3>5. The offense has five seconds to inbound the ball</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>After the offense scores a basket, the opposing team receives possession of the ball. One of their players has to inbound the ball from a designated spot on the sidelines of the court to resume gameplay. The player has five seconds to pass the ball to another player on his team, or else the team loses possession. The defender cannot contact the ball when the offensive player is trying to inbound it, or the referee can issue a technical foul.

                 <div class="inset"><h3>6. The offense must advance the ball</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once an offensive team advances the ball past the half-court line, the ballhandler may not cross that line again, or a referee will award possession of the ball to the opposing team.</p>
                 </div>
                 <br>
                 <div class="inset"><h3>7. Ball and ballhandler must remain inbounds</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>During gameplay, the player with possession of the ball must stay within the designated inbounds lines marked on the court. If a player steps out of bounds or touches this line with their foot while holding the ball, the referee will award possession to the opposing team. Additionally, if a player shoots the ball while their foot is touching the line and the shot is successful, it will not count.</p>

                 <div class="inset"><h3>8. Defenders canâ€™t interfere with a shot on a downward trajectory</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p> Once an offensive player shoots the ball towards the basket, it is considered illegal for a defensive player to interfere with the ball while it is in the process of descending towards the rim. Such interference, known as a goaltend, can lead to an automatic field goal being awarded to the opposing team.</p>
