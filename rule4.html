                <div class="inset"><h3>13. Illegal contact results in a personal foul</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>A personal foul occurs when a player breaches the regulations of the game, such as by pushing, blocking or striking another player while they are shooting. These kinds of fouls result in free throw attempts for the player that was fouled. If a defender commits a foul against a two-point shooter, the shooter receives two free throws. In the case of a three-point shot attempt, if the shooter is fouled, they will get three free throws. Should the illegal contact take place during the player's original shot, and they successfully make it, their basket counts and they receive one free throw.

                 <div class="inset"><h3>14. Excessive contact results in a flagrant foul</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Flagrant fouls refer to a personal foul that can potentially injure the opponent. These fouls carry heavier penalties, such as fines, immediate ejection, and even suspension. There are two types of flagrant fouls: flagrant foul—penalty (1) and flagrant foul—penalty (2). Flagrant 1 refers to fouls involving unnecessary contact. The penalty for this foul type is a free throw for the opponent and possession of the ball. Flagrant 2 refers to any foul involving unnecessary and excessive contact. Officials perform an instant-play review to determine if an act qualifies for the flagrant 2 penalty. If it does, the player at fault is assessed a fine and an automatic ejection from the game, and the opposing team receives free throws and possession of the ball.</p>

                 <div class="inset"><h3>15. Charges and illegal screens result in an offensive foul</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>An offensive foul occurs when a player on the attacking team violates the rules while their team has possession of the ball. The most commonly committed types of such fouls are charging and illegal screening. Charging is when an offensive player collides with a defensive player who remains stationary, often resulting in physical contact. On the other hand, an illegal screen happens when an offensive player obstructs a defender's movement by changing position while setting up a pick for their teammate with the ball.</p>

                 <div class="inset"><h3>16. Certain rule violations result in technical fouls</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>When a player or coach violates the administrative rules of a game, they may receive a technical foul as a penalty. This type of foul is often given for behavior such as fighting or verbal abuse, and coaches may even receive this penalty if they become excessively confrontational when disputing a call with officials. When a player receives a technical foul, it results in a free throw and loss of possession for the team. If a player or coach accumulates two technical fouls during the same game, they will be ejected from play. Individuals who repeatedly receive technical fouls can face suspension from both regular season and playoff games.</p>
